## üéØ Problem Statement

The aviation industry faces a persistent challenge in achieving *optimal operational efficiency* while minimizing *fuel consumption* and *environmental impact*.  
Current tools provide only *basic emissions calculations* or *fragmented insights*, lacking real-time predictive intelligence.

Airlines operate vast fleets under *dynamic conditions* influenced by:
- Aircraft type and payload  
- Weather variability  
- Route changes  
- Maintenance constraints  

However, without an integrated, data-driven backend, it becomes difficult to:
- Proactively detect inefficiencies  
- Identify in-flight anomalies  
- Analyze long-term operational trends  

Moreover, the *real-time processing of massive, diverse datasets* across disparate systems remains a major bottleneck.

## üí° Solution Overview

*SKYSQL* addresses these challenges with a *unified Predictive Aviation Intelligence Platform, powered entirely by **MariaDB SkySQL*.  
It combines predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and diagnostic intelligence within a single, scalable system.

### üîç How It Solves the Problem
- Ingests *real-time flight telemetry* and *historical datasets*.  
- Uses *ML models* (TensorFlow / Scikit-learn) to predict *fuel consumption* and detect anomalies.  
- Enables *proactive route optimization, reducing both **fuel burn* and *CO‚ÇÇ emissions*.  
- Integrates *InnoDB, **Temporal Tables, and **Vector Engine* for analytics, auditing, and real-time similarity search.

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Concept  
Integrate *predictive analytics, **real-time anomaly detection, and **diagnostic intelligence* into one unified aviation data platform.  
MariaDB SkySQL serves as the *core engine, handling both **OLTP + OLAP workloads* within a single ecosystem.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Principles  

1. *Data Unification Principle* ‚Äì Centralize all aviation data (historical, live telemetry, and environmental) into one system.  
2. *Predictive Intelligence Principle* ‚Äì Apply ML models to predict outcomes such as fuel burn and anomalies.  
3. *Scalability & Reliability* ‚Äì Leverage MariaDB‚Äôs distributed architecture for petabyte-scale data handling.  
4. *Transparency & Auditability* ‚Äì Maintain time-versioned records with Temporal Tables.  
5. *Real-Time Responsiveness* ‚Äì Use Vector Search for live anomaly detection and similarity matching.
